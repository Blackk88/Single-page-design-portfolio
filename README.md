Single page desing portfolio challenge from Frontend Mentor. It was great opportunity to practice my HTML, CSS skills to create this fully responsive web page. Also I made simple carousel using JS. It was very interesting project, where I can practice more with Grid CSS layout - how easy it allows to create responsive layouts.
